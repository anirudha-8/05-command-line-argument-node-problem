Once you've completed the basics, try adding:

- Default Value: If no name is provided, default to "World" (e.g., "Hello, World!").

- Multiple Arguments: Allow passing multiple names and greet each one individually.

- Argument Validation: Handle invalid or extra arguments gracefully.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
